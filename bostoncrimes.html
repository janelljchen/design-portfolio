            <h1> Why Boston Crimes? </h1>
            <p> What makes some Boston neighborhoods safer than other? What can the city of Boston do to help reduce crime rates? Since there are many factors influencing crime, we chose to focus on those which can be most easily controlled, such as infrastructure and placement of safety resources.

            <h2> Problem </h2>
            <p> We have chosen to address two specific issues in relation to analyzing crime and taking preventative measures; (1) Is the number of streetlight in a district correlated to the number of crimes in Boston?; (2) What is the optimal way to place night patrols in each district such that every street will be covered?
    
            </p>
            <h2> Motivation </h2>
            <p>While it is difficult to determine what exactly is the cause, we hope that by better understanding these crimes, we could potentially reduce the number of incidences in Boston. Our motivation to improve this issue stems from the following questions:

            <h2> Research </h2>
              <p>What makes some Boston neighborhoods safer than others? What can the city of Boston do to help reduce crime rates? To answer these questions, weâ€™ll be analyzing the influence of various factors, such as the presence of streetlights, which may explain the crime-rate differences in Boston neighborhoods.

              And secondly, we aim to suggest preventive measures for the city in an optimal way. </p>

              <h6> Usability: </h6>
              <div class="adv-points">
                <p>We used Z3 Solver to solve a constraint satisfaction problem; it determines a model for each district (neighborhood) given constraints. Multiple streets can
                   be covered by a night patrol if they're less than 1 block away (approx 800 ft. or 0.15 miles), as specified in the equations. </p>
                <p>This is similar to the edge cover problem in which the streets are nodes, and edges exist between them if they are a certain distance away. The model will tell us whether all
                  nodes can be covered, as well as the minimum number that allows all nodes to be covered</p>

              <div class="adv-points">
              <p>If there are too many constraints in the dataset, it is possible for the solver to be unable to find a satisfying solution. Moreover, finding the optimal (minimal number) is not efficient in running time. It requires trying all possible values
                 until hitting the minimum. Although this can be sped up with binary search, it is still quite slow overall

              <div class="adv-points">
                <p>We aimed to uncover correlation between number of streetlights and number of crimes that occur in Boston neighborhoods. We hypothesized that outdoor lighting would reduce crime (i.e. there would be a negative correlation between number of streetlights and number of crimes in a given neighborhood) </p>
    
                <p>Using the Data Mechanics Library (DML), we ran a correlation between the number of streetlights, and the number of crimes occurring in each neighborhood within the last year. This resulted in a correlation coefficient of +.9375.

              <h6> Limitations:</h6>
              <div class="adv-points">
              <p>We faced some difficulty trying to aggregate data to the neighborhood level. Some datasets indicated location with zip code and others with street address. Since we wanted to identify patterns on a smaller scale, we had to use the Analyze Boston Neighborhoods datasets, which provided GeoJSON polygons, to determine whether a crime of streetlight fell within the bounds of a neighborhood.

           <h1>Conclusion</h1>
           </div>
           <h2>Graph of the correlation</h2>
           <p> By (1) analyzing the relationship between street lights and crime incidences, and (2) determining potential optimal locations for night patrols, we have found from (1) that the relationship between streetlights and crimes has a p-value of +.9375. Several factors may account for these unexpected results. It is possible for neighborhoods with larger populations to likely have both more crimes and streetlights. Additionally, itâ€™s possible that light does not in fact deter crime. We have also generated from (2) the optimal (minimal) patrol placement so that streets where crimes occur are covered within a certain number of feet.</p>
    
            <h2> Meaning </h2>
            <p>The relationship between streetlights and crimes has a correlation coefficient of +.9375. Our results suggest a positive correlation between number of streetlights and the number of crimes in a neighborhood.
              Since we did consider factors such as size of neighborhood, we cannot reasonably conclude increasing outdoor light
              has any effect on crime rates. </p>

            <p>This script will allow you to visualize our data and run our algorithm (getOpt.py) with our web app. The app takes in the input of number of feet and district from the user. And based on the inputs, our algorithm will determine exactly which streets will have a patrol, such that every street in the selected district within the specified feet is covered. The assignments are optimally placed such that the number of patrols is minimized. </p>
            <p>API:  Uses the Google Maps API to display results, with markers indicating where the patrols would be placed. </p>
