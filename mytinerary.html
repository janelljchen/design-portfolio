              <p> Our target user group will be mainly focused on Yvette, which comprises of young adults,
              between the ages of 18-35, who are often familiar and experienced with the newest technology.
    
              Yvette (Age group: 18 - 35 (Young adults)): Yvette is familiar with latest technology,
              including a lot of the modern day flights, transportation, and booking apps. It’s easy for Yvette
               to adopt to newest apps and technology. She’s willing to go on adventures! But she dislikes getting lost in foreign destinations.

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>In conducting this user study, we aim to identify the needs of members of the general public likely to use our proposed app.
                  In general, our app is intended to assist travellers with the planning of their trips as well as day to day
                  activities when in unfamiliar places.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <h2>Methodology</h2>
              <p>We will be using two methodologies: (1) Surveying and (2) Conducting Interviews.</p>
    
              <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-poll"></i></div>
              <p>Surveying: In this method, we will post questions through an online survey (Google forms) to confirm or deny assumptions about the user groups Yvette and Orlando. We will also be asking what existing tools are often used by the users. Sample size is 50.
              </p>
    
    
              <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-users"></i></div>
    
              <p>Conducting Interviews: During interviews, we will be asking the participants directly. First, we will have them collect travel planning artefacts produced by travellers, such as checklists and timetables. Then we will find out how they plan for trips to figure out what features are important for their planning. We will also be using survey questions to kick start the interview.
                </p>
    
              <h8>Note: Since it is unlikely for them to be able to plan a trip on the spot, we can ask to show artefacts produced for previous or current trips and reflect on them.
              </h8>
    
              <h2>Interview Dates</h2>

            <h1>Analysis Findings</h1>
          </div>
    
            <h2>User-Task Matrix Analysis</h2>
            <p> The user-task matrix was used to identify frequently completed tasks along with critical tasks to focus on during the design phase.
            By analyzing the results, we can determine tasks to prioritize. </p>
            <p> For example, tasks that are done by many user groups with moderate to high frequency, should be efficient and effective.
              For us, we found that tasks like changing plans / modifying itinerary and finding transportation are frequently completed
              among all user groups and should therefore have good usability.
            </p>
    
            <p>We also identified critical tasks that done less often and therefore should be very easy for the user to understand and complete.
              Tasks we found that fit this category are downloading reservations, accessing the reservations, and boarding flights. Users only complete
              these tasks a few times, so we can note that in the design phase we should make sure the interface related to these tasks should focus on
              preventing errors and be easy to learn. </p>
    
            <h2>Survey Analysis</h2>
            <p> As mentioned above, the idea behind using the survey methodology is to obtain a large amount of unbiased data.
              The survey questions were focused on identifying problem areas that travellers face while planning a trip.

            <p>The results of two survey questions; a majority of people still keep hard copies of reservations
              Therefore, we identified keeping track of ones’ flight and accommodation reservations as a relevant task.</p>
          </div>
            <p>Other important tasks were also identified through the analysis of our survey results. For example, we found that people tend
              to focus mostly on planning for sightseeing and food when going abroad (86% noted they spent the most time planning on these areas). </p>
    
            <p>Also, 82% of survey-takers also noted they prefer public transportation for transportation while abroad. This helped us identify
              another important task for travellers: understanding and using the country’s public transportation system. </p>
    
        <h2>Interview Analysis</h2>
        <p> Through our surveys and user-task matrix, we were able to identify key tasks completed by users while travelling.
           In our interviews, we attempted to locate the root of the problems that users face in the travel planning process. </p>
    
         <div class="quotes">
         <h5> “I determine number of days by gut feelings and availability” </h5>
         <h5> “They don’t consider opening hours for activities and attractions”</h5>
         <h5> “I prefer longer holidays”</h5>
         <h5> “I like that the food apps have reviews”</h5>
         </div>
    
          <p> For example, a common response we found in our interviews with users who call under the category “Yvette” (young adult), is that they
            like to find food near them spontaneously rather than planning ahead of time all of their dining plans. After asking for clarification, an
            interviewee noted that itinerary apps and other planning apps “don’t consider opening hours for activities and attractions”. They went on to
             explain an anecdote where a restaurant they had planned to visit turned out to be closed on the day they went to visit. </p>
    
             <p>From this, we can
             conclude the root issue that travellers face when planning is the inability for an itinerary to keep track of opening hours of various locations.
             Therefore, we plan to implement a feature for keeping track of the operating hours of businesses during the planning process to counter this problem.
             </p>

              <p>After completing the (1) Online Survey, (2) Interviews, and (3) Competitive Benchmark Analysis, we have found several common pain points
                shared among them, as well as some positive user or technological traits. We have found the following commonalities in all three:
                Users tend to change or modify plans, users must keep track of flight & accommodations, users will use public transport, and users
                dislike the disorganization of files or apps used.</p>
